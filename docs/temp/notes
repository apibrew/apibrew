Building a REST API: Developers could use data-handler to quickly build a REST API for their application. They could define their data models in a proto file, generate server and client code using the protoc compiler, and then use the generated code to create a scalable API server.

Microservices: Developers could use data-handler to build microservices that expose CRUD operations over HTTP or gRPC. Each microservice could have its own data model and schema, and data-handler could be used to handle the underlying data storage, validation, and querying.

Backend for Frontend (BFF): Frontend developers could use data-handler to automatically generate a backend service for their application. This backend service could then handle data access and processing, allowing the frontend to remain focused on user experience.

Integration with existing systems: Developers could use data-handler to integrate new applications with existing systems, by building a data-handler service that connects to legacy systems and exposes a modern API for new applications.

These are just a few examples of how data-handler could be used. Its flexibility and extensibility make it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

A web application that needs a backend to manage user data, such as registration, login, and profile management. The frontend developers could use the code generator to automatically generate the necessary backend APIs and data models based on their desired specifications, allowing them to focus on building the user interface.

An enterprise application that needs to integrate with various third-party services, such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and customer relationship management systems. The code generator could be used to automatically generate the necessary API wrappers and data models for each service, streamlining the integration process and reducing the risk of errors.

A mobile application that needs to interact with a custom database schema. The code generator could be used to automatically generate the necessary API endpoints and data models based on the schema definition, allowing the mobile developers to easily read and write data to the database without having to manually write complex SQL queries.

A microservices architecture where each microservice has a well-defined API contract. The code generator could be used to automatically generate the necessary client and server code for each microservice based on the API contract, reducing the amount of manual code needed and allowing developers to focus on the business logic of each service.
